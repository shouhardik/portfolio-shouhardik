      "description": "An AI model was developed to analyze brain scans, aiming to detect patterns indicative of neurological disorders. This involved comprehensive data analysis, including intensity normalization, image segmentation, and augmentation techniques. The model architecture utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with two convolutional layers, each followed by max-pooling, batch normalization, and dropout layers. These layers were instrumental in capturing complex patterns within the data. Additionally, Bayesian optimization was employed to explore the hyperparameter space and optimize the model's performance, specifically maximizing validation accuracy",
